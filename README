         Introduction to Natural Laguage Processing Assignment 2
 
==========================================================================================

1. In this assignment, you will be asked to:

  From Incrementality in Deterministic Dependency Parsing(2004, Nivre)
  - Implemented the arc-standard algorithm

  From A Fast and Accurate Dependency Parser using Neural Networks(2014, Danqi and Manning) 
  - Implemented feature extraction
  - Implemented the neural network architecture including activation function
  - Implemented loss function


3. What you should do:
  1. Implemented the arc-standard algorithm in ParsingSystem.py
  -apply function is implemented, to find the next configuration      
  2. Implement feature extraction in DependencyParser.py
  - implemented getfeatures to generate 48 features for each configuration
  3. Implement neural network architecture including activation function
  - graph with 1/2 hidden layers is built and tried out diffent activation functions
  4. Implement loss function and calculate loss value
  - implemented the loss given in the paper i.e softmax cross entrpy + l2 regularizer loss

Have changed the fowwing files:
  1. DependencyParser.py
  2. ParsingSystem.py 
  3. Config.py: Added hidden layer2 size and tried by increasing the max-itrerations
